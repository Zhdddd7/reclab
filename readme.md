# RecLab: A place for recommendation algorithms test
RecLab is a toolkit designed to streamline the development of recommendation system demos and experiments. It aims to provide a user-friendly environment for quickly building, evaluating, and experimenting with various recommendation algorithms, datasets, and feature engineering workflows.
## Key Features
* Easy Recommendation Demo Setup
* Built-in Datasets with Lazy and Chunked Loading
* Feature Engineering Tools
* Model Building and Classic Algorithms
## Getting Started
### Installation
```
pip install reclab
```
### Loading a Dataset
```
from reclab.datasets import BLOG_REC  # Example dataset loader

# Initialize the dataset; no data is loaded yet
blog_rec_dataset = BLOG_REC()

# Iterate over the dataset to trigger lazy loading and chunk processing
for i, row in enumerate(train_dataset):
    print(row)
    if i > 10:
        break
```
### Multi-Table and Slicing
```
print(blog_rec_dataset.list_tables())
print(blog_rec_dataset.info())
print(blog_rec_dataset.table_info('Author Data.csv'))
# Iterate over the first 500 rows of Author Data
for i, user_row in enumerate(dataset.get_table_iter("Author Data.csv", start=0, end=500)):
    if i < 5:
        print(user_row)
    else:
        break
```
